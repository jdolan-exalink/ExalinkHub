## Core Features:

- Centralized Event Logging: Aggregates event data (object detections, LPR) from multiple Frigate instances into a single searchable log. Employs a 'tool' to automatically categorize and prioritize events based on configurable rules, enhancing security monitoring.
- Unified Camera View: Provides a single interface to view live camera feeds from multiple Frigate servers.
- Aggregated Recording Playback: Allows users to search, browse, and playback video recordings from multiple Frigate servers through a single, unified timeline.
- Configurable Server Connections: An administrative interface to add, edit, and remove connections to Frigate servers.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) to evoke a sense of security, stability, and professionalism, aligning with the critical nature of video surveillance.
- Background color: Very light grey (#F5F5F5), close to white, for high contrast.
- Accent color: Purple (#9C27B0) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif for titles; body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for body text, to ensure clarity and legibility.
- Use clean, simple icons to represent different camera types, event types, and system functions.
- A grid-based layout provides a structured and scalable foundation for displaying live feeds and event data. The menu bar must be persistent at the top to quickly reach major functions of the app.
- Subtle animations to improve user experience.
